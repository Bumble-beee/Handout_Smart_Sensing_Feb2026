# Handout_Smart_Sensing_Feb2026

with this email, you receive instructions on your personalized exam project for the course Data Science in Fluid Mechanics. Attached you will find two PDFs with the detailed instructions – one for a general overview of the project timeline and one with detailed tasks to be carried out. The corresponding data sets can be downloaded via this link: https://cloud.tu-braunschweig.de/s/pN7FfiRW5HJtzSk  
 
Here is a short summary of the key points:
•        You will have exactly 4 weeks (until July 16th) to work on your project, prepare corresponding routines in either matlab or python, and to upload your code to this provided cloud folder: https://cloud.tu-braunschweig.de/s/5EbbW8JKPWTrDrn
•        You should make sure to properly annotate your code, that key results are visualized or otherwise presented to the user, and that the code can be run on a different computer, i.e. all required libraries or subfunctions should be included in the submission.
•        You prepare a short (max. 15 minutes) presentation of your key results, which will be given on July 23rd at 10:00 in the morning. Please make sure to properly introduce your dataset(s), visualize the results, and discuss key findings.
 
Your grade will be composed of the following parts:
•        Exectuability of the submitted code, i.e. does it produce the required results? (10%)
•        Correctness of produced results. (20%)
•        Documentation of the code (10%)
•        Quality of presentation (30%)
•        Answers to questions after the presentation (30%)
